Privacy Policy
Protecting your privacy is very important to us. We hope that the following statement will help you understand how InstaShot handles personally identifiable information ("PII") that you occasionally provide to us via the Internet ("Google Play" platform).
Normally, when you download our Android application, we will not collect any PII from you. Specifically, we do not require consumers to register before downloading the application, nor do we need to track consumer access to our application. We do not even have a server to store such PII.
We can only access your PII when you personally decide to send us feedback via email or provide us with a bug report. In this case, the PII we may obtain from you is limited to your name, email address and survey response.
In the above cases, we guarantee that your personally identifiable information is only used to contact you and improve our services. We will never use such information (such as your name and email address) for any other purpose, for example, to further promote our products, or to disclose your personal information to third parties for commercial gain.
It should be noted that whether you send your feedback or error report to us is entirely up to you. If you are worried about your PII being abused, or want to know more about our privacy policy and its meaning, please feel free to email us at t.jzytndij9119@gmail.com, we will be happy to provide clear answers to your questions in a timely manner .
